# Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Pre-Project Reflection:
I am going to create a JavaScript project from scratch. It is a game of rock paper scissors. It will be played entirely in the browser console.

I am currently nervous and confused on how to go about doing this since this is my first actual vanilla JavaScript program. This will test me and I am sure I will come out the other end being stronger and more confident in JavaScript. 

The key learning I wish to improve out of this project (Other than improving JavaScript skills) is to enhance problem solving skills. Specifically the skill to Plan out the project via Psuedocode and then write the code towards the end. I have a lot to learn and I am hopeful that I can acheive it.
